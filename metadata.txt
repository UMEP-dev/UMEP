about=
      UMEP is an extensive plugin designed for urban climate in general and climate sensitive planning applications in particular. The plugin consist of a pre-processor, a processor and a post-processor. This plugin is a collaboration between University of Gothenburg, University of Helsinki and University of Reading.
      
      Some of the tools in UMEP requires Python libraries not included in the default QGIS installation. See Section 2.3 in the UMEP homepage.

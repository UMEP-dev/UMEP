.. currentmodule:: xlutils

1.7.1 (25 April 2014)
---------------------

- Add support for time cells in :class:`~xlutils.view.View`.

- Add support for ``.xlsx`` files in :class:`~xlutils.view.View` at the
  expense of formatting information being available.

1.7.0 (29 October 2013)
-----------------------

- Added the :mod:`xlutils.view` module.

1.6.0 (5 April 2013)
--------------------

- Moved documentation to be Sphinx based.

- Support for :mod:`xlrd` 0.9.1, which no longer has pickleable
  books.

  .. note:: You may encounter performance problems if you work with
            large spreadsheets and use :mod:`xlutils` 1.6.0 with
            :mod:`xlrd` versions earlier that 0.9.1. 

1.5.2 (13 April 2012)
---------------------

- When using :mod:`xlutils.copy`, the ``datemode`` is now copied across from the
  source solving date problems with certain files.

- The :mod:`errorhandler` package is no longer a hard dependency.

- As a minimum, :mod:`xlrd` 0.7.2 and :mod:`xlwt` 0.7.4 are now required.

1.5.1 (5 March 2012)
--------------------

- Fix packaging problem caused by the move to git

1.5.0 (5 March 2012)
--------------------

  factors are now copied.

------------------------

- Removal of references in the `finish` methods of several filters,
  easing memory usage in large filtering runs

  expense of speed.

  :class:`~xlutils.filter.ErrorFilter`. :mod:`xlwt` has always supported boolean
  cells.

- :class:`~xlutils.filter.BaseReader` now opens workbooks with ``on_demand = True``

- Added support for :mod:`xlrd` Books opened with ``on_demand`` as ``True`` passed to

This is the official repository for the Urban Multi-scale Universal Predictor (UMEP). UMEP includes various climate sensitive planning tools and comes as a plugin for QGIS (www.qgis.org). UMEP will eventually be available from the QGIS official plugin repository but in the mean time, it can be downloaded from here. 

Go to downloads and follow the instructions in the UMEP_get_started.pdf document.

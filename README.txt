This is the official repository for the Urban Multi-scale Universal Predictor (UMEP). UMEP includes various climate sensitive planning tools 
and comes as a plugin for QGIS (www.qgis.org). UMEP will eventually be available from the QGIS official plugin repository but in the mean 
time, it can be downloaded from here. 

Go to downloads and follow the instructions in the UMEP_get_started.pdf document.
